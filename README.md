# Food Donation
  The purpose of our system is to make it easier for restaurants to help people in need. After a restaurant has had a lunch service, there is a high probability that there is food over. The restaurant can therefore advertise the food in our system. The charity organization can then book these meals in order to give to people who need food. In summary, the system is to help people get food in their stomachs.

  The system is built with an app where you can create users, these users can either be a restaurant or a charity organization. Depending on the type of user you are, you will be able to do different things. Restaurant users can do the following things:

  - Add meals.
  - Change their meals.
  - Remove meals.
  - Change their user account.
  - And more

  The charities' users can do the following things:

- See where the restaurants are located on a map.
- Tap a restaurant and see their ads.
- They can see where the next meals are located.
- They can book meals.n
- They can see booked meals.
- They can change their user account.
- And more
